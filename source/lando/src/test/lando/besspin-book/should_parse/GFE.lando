system Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)
The SSITH GFE is the hardware platform upon which SSITH TA-1
performers add security.  It includes six RISC-V SoCs, three
operating systems, device drivers, and more.

subsystem RISC-V System on Chip (SOC)
The SSITH SoC is one of six SoCs that contain RISC-V CPUs.

subsystem Piccolo CPU (Bluespec-P1)
The Piccolo CPU is a RISC-V microcontroller written by Bluespec in
Bluespec SystemVerilog.  It is one of the six CPUs used in the
GFE.

subsystem BESSPIN HSM (HSM)
The HSM for the GFE contains sufficient crypto IP in order to
accellerate GFE trusted boot.

component AES IP (AES)
An AES hardware module.

component AES Secret Key (Key)
The secret key held in an AES hardware module.

// @note kiniry Due to the above layout of the specs, these two
// containment specs are valid:
//   `HSM contains AES`
//   `HSM contains Key`

relation GFE contains SoC
relation SoC contains Bluespec-P1

requirements Information Leakage

// These are not consistent with each other, you should
// definitely comment some of these out
//add_leaks
//The add instruction leaks timing information.
//
//mul_does_not_leak
//The mul instruction does not leak timing information.
//
//arithmetic_leaks
//All integer instructions leak timing information.

only_multiply_leaks
Only the mul instruction out of all the integer_ops instructions leaks timing information.

// no_instruction_leaks
// No instruction leaks timing information.

io_kill_signal_not_leaked 
The io__kill signal of the MulDiv Verilog module of my chisel_p2 processor isn't leaked
through an information-flow channel.

// alu_input1_not_leaked_ALU_module
// The io_in1 signal of the ALU Verilog module isn't leaked outside of the
// certification boundary of my ALU module.

//alu_comparator_input2_not_leaked
//The io_in2 signal of the ALU Verilog module isn't leaked through the io_cmp_out output channel.

alu_input1_not_leaked
The io_in1 signal of the ALU Verilog module isn't leaked through an information-flow channel.

alu_input2_not_leaked
The io_in2 signal of the ALU Verilog module isn't leaked through an information-flow channel.
