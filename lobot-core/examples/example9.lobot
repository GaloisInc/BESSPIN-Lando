bounded_int : kind of int where 0 <= self, self <= 10

nested : kind of struct
  with f : struct with a : bounded_int, b : bounded_int
       g : struct with x : bounded_int
                       y : struct
                            with
                             z : bounded_int
  where f.a = g.y.z,
        f.b = 10
